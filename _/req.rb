I want to build a scoring system/app to allow, parents/guidiance be able to also track performance and assessments and assignments for their ward.

We use excel sheet currently to record assessments and assignments for all/each students based on their enrolled courses.

Our courses are structured in lessons, each lessons have both assessments and assignments.

Like, when I open a student's profile, I can track courses they're enrolled in and when opening a particular course, we can get their performance in those courses, accessments records
assignments recorded, etc..


Certificates and attendance, and stats
An Instructor can take/b assigned to more than 1 course.
Scores can be commented on.

like Python - has up to 12 lessons and each, with assessments and assignments, that must be recorded for each enrolled students per session or when they take the course. Instructors do the reccording after each class.

Tech stack: React Bootstrap and fastAPI.

Do everything professionally, completely, design clean schema/DB diagram as well.
